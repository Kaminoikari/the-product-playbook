## ✨ What Is This?

The Product Playbook is a **Claude AI Skill** that systematically guides you through end-to-end product planning, from zero to one. It is not just a prompt — it is a complete interactive framework guidance system that includes:

- 🧭 **6 execution modes** — from 30-minute rapid validation to full-blown product plans (including a feature expansion fast track)
- 📐 **22 product frameworks** — covering the entire Discovery → Define → Develop → Deliver pipeline
- 🔄 **Change propagation engine** — modify any step and all downstream outputs update automatically
- 📎 **Smart file integration** — upload data, screenshots, or documents; the AI automatically integrates them into the relevant step
- 🔗 **Dev handoff** — generates CLAUDE.md + TASKS.md + TICKETS.md for seamless handoff to Claude Code development
- 📊 **Multi-format output** — HTML reports, PRDs, PowerPoint decks, dev handoff packages

**Trigger the entire flow with a single sentence:**

```
I want to build a product
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Claude.ai Custom Skill

1. Download this repo as a zip file
2. Go to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → Settings → Custom Skills
3. Upload the entire `the-product-playbook/` folder
4. Say "I want to build a product" in a conversation to trigger the skill

### Option 2: Claude Code Skill (Recommended)

> 💡 To update: simply re-run the install command to overwrite with the latest version.

| Method | Best for | Requirements |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| ① Copy & Paste | Beginners | Just open Claude Code |
| ② One-line install | Developers | Terminal |
| ③ Manual install | Custom paths | Terminal + git |

#### ① Copy & Paste Install (Easiest)

After launching Claude Code, paste the following and Claude will handle the installation automatically:

```
Please run the following commands to install (or update) the-product-playbook skill,
and tell me the result when done:

git clone https://github.com/kaminoikari/the-product-playbook.git /tmp/the-product-playbook
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/commands
cp -r /tmp/the-product-playbook ~/.claude/skills/the-product-playbook
cp /tmp/the-product-playbook/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
rm -rf /tmp/the-product-playbook
```

#### ② One-line Install (Terminal)

```bash

## 🔑 Key Features

### 📎 Smart File Integration

Upload supplementary files at any step — the AI automatically identifies and integrates them:

| Upload | Auto-integrated into |
|--------|---------------------|
| Competitor screenshots | Positioning analysis |
| Interview transcripts | Persona + JTBD |
| User data CSV | Opportunity assessment + PMF evaluation |
| Market report PDF | Opportunity assessment + Strategy |
| Existing PRD | Revision mode + MVP |

### 🔄 Change Propagation Engine

Modify any upstream step and downstream outputs update automatically:

```
Modify JTBD → auto-updates HMW, Positioning, PR-FAQ, North Star, Product Spec Summary
Modify MVP  → auto-updates User Stories, DB Schema, Product Spec Summary
```

### 🔗 Dev Handoff

Generate a complete dev handoff package and kick off Claude Code development with a single command:

```
📦 Dev Handoff Package
├── CLAUDE.md          → Claude Code project memory
├── TASKS.md           → Feature breakdown + phased delivery
├── TICKETS.md         → Ticket list (ready for Jira/Asana/Linear)
├── docs/
│   ├── PRD.md         → Full PRD
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md → DB Schema + API + directory structure
│   └── PRODUCT-SPEC.md → Product spec summary
└── scripts/
    └── setup.sh       → One-click initialization script
```

```bash
# Start development in Claude Code with a single command
> Please read CLAUDE.md and TASKS.md, start executing Phase 0
```

### 🔥 Plan Directly on Existing Systems (Build Mode Killer Feature)

Launch **Build Mode** inside an existing project directory — Claude Code reads your codebase while doing product planning, effectively merging **product planning** and **technical feasibility assessment** into a single flow:

```
Your Existing Project                 Product Playbook
┌─────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────────┐
│ src/             │  ← auto-scan → │ Pre-mortem risk      │
│ db/schema.sql    │  ← auto-scan → │ MVP scoping          │
│ api/routes/      │  ← auto-scan → │ RICE prioritization  │
│ package.json     │  ← auto-scan → │ User Story breakdown │
│ CLAUDE.md        │  ← auto-scan → │ Dev handoff (delta)  │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
```

**Usage example:**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your existing project
cd /path/to/your-existing-project

# 2. Launch Claude Code
claude

# 3. Use Build Mode and describe the feature you want to add
> /product-build I want to add real-time notifications to my existing system
```

Claude Code will automatically:
- Scan your directory structure, tech stack, and DB schema
- Run Pre-mortem based on your **real architecture** (not hypothetical risks)
- Generate MVP and User Stories that plug directly into existing modules
- Produce a dev handoff package as an **incremental plan**, not a greenfield build

> 💡 **Why is this powerful?** Traditional product planning and technical assessment are separate processes — PMs write specs, toss them to engineers, and engineers say "this can't be done." Build Mode grounds the planning process in real system constraints, eliminating the back-and-forth.

### 🔒 Security Built In

Dev handoff packages automatically include security architecture — no afterthought patching:

- **OWASP Top 10 checklist** — input validation, authentication/authorization, XSS/CSRF protection
- **Security architecture section** — CORS policies, CSP headers, rate limiting, API security middleware
- **.gitignore template** — auto-excludes `.env`, credentials, progress files
- **Pre-mortem security scenarios** — data breaches, account takeovers, API abuse as mandatory considerations

### 📦 Cross-Session Product Context Accumulation

Planning outputs are automatically saved to `.product-context.md` and loaded on the next session:

```
1st session (Full Mode) → saves Identity + Core Strategy + Architecture
2nd session (Feature Expansion) → auto-loads tech stack and modules, skipping redundant collection
3rd session (Revision Mode) → carries forward historical decisions and known pain points, focusing on deltas
```

### 🏢 Automatic B2B / B2C Adaptation

Once the product type is confirmed, frameworks auto-adapt:

| Aspect | B2C | B2B |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Persona | Individual motivation segmentation | Buyer + User dual Persona |
| PMF | DAU / Retention / Sean Ellis | Paying customers / NRR / NPS |
| North Star | Core action completion count | ARR / Net Revenue Retention |
| Aha Moment | Within first use | Onboarding / Time-to-Value |

## 📊 Quality Benchmark Results

By comparing response quality between "with Skill guidance" and "without Skill guidance" using automated AI grading, we quantify the real impact of the Skill.

### Four Iterations Compared

| Iteration | Test Items | With Skill Pass Rate | Without Skill Pass Rate | Delta |
|-----------|:--------:|:-------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----:|
| Iteration 1 (Baseline) | 6 | 100% | 57.4% | +42.6% |
| Iteration 2 | 6 | 100% | 63.3% | +36.7% |
| Iteration 3 | 6 | 94.1% | 38.2% | +55.9% |
| **Iteration 4 (Latest)** | **9** | **100%** | **31%** | **+69% ✅** |

### Iteration 4 Detailed Results (9 tests × 49 expectations)

| Test Item | With Skill | Without Skill | Delta |
|-----------|:--------:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Mode Selection (3-step progressive) | 100% | 0% | +100% |
| Quick Mode JTBD Analysis | 100% | 43% | +57% |
| JTBD Depth (B2B org-level) | 100% | 57% | +43% |
| PR-FAQ Writing | 100% | 33% | +67% |
| Revision Mode | 100% | 67% | +33% |
| Quality Self-check Hard Gate | 100% | 0% | +100% |
| **Feature Expansion Mode (New)** | **100%** | **17%** | **+83%** |
| **Security Integration (New)** | **100%** | **25%** | **+75%** |
| **Context Bootstrap (New)** | **100%** | **0%** | **+100%** |

### Key Findings

- **Quality Self-check Hard Gate** (+100%): Whether the AI proactively critiques its own output with strict standards, flags gaps, and demands improvement after completing a deliverable — 0% pass rate without the Skill
- **Context Bootstrap** (+100%): Whether the AI collects foundational product information before starting to plan, rather than jumping straight into technical implementation — completely skipped without the Skill
- **Feature Expansion Mode** (+83%): Whether the AI recognizes "adding a feature to an existing product" scenarios and activates a streamlined 4-step flow instead of the full 7-12 steps — without the Skill, it jumps straight to technical solutions
- **Security Integration** (+75%): Whether the dev handoff includes security architecture, .gitignore templates, and platform-specific security measures — without the Skill, security is reduced to a single summary table
